## About Me
I am a Brazilian web developer with a diverse background. Initially, I earned a degree in Physiotherapy from University of Fortaleza in 2007 and spent over 10 years working in aesthetic Physiotherapy. In 2016, I moved to Canada, became a mother, and decided to pursue a new passion: web development.

After completing a full-stack web development bootcamp in 2024, I transitioned into the world of website creation, where I combine my attention to detail and problem-solving skills. I’m passionate about building clean, responsive, and performant websites, with a focus on delivering exceptional user experiences. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I’m always eager to learn new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
