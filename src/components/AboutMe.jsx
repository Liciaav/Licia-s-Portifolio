      <p class="about-me-description ">I am Brazilian. I have a degree in Physiotherapy and have worked in aesthetic Physiotherapy for over 10 years. I moved to Canada in 2016 and I worked as Physiotherapy Assistante until the pandemic started. After that, I became a mother and I decided to stay home and take care of my children until they started school. During that time, I realized that I needed to change careers and work from home. I started looking for a new career and found everything I wanted in web development. Now I am a web developer who loves creating clean, user-friendly, and performant websites. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks, I strive to deliver exceptional web experiences. I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to improve my skills.</p>
